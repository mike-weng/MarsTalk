# MarsTalk

Have you ever wondered why in high school you have no problems making friends, creating memories, chatting with friend till late at night, but at University it is just not as easy to have a close friend. Many people find it hard to make friend at uni, and I mean real close friends. This is mainly because there is a wide diversity of students at University; each with potentially very different background, experiences and interests than you. Furthermore, university life can get real busy with individual studies, part-time jobs or clubs, and in lectures people just come and go. It is especially hard to move from just a hi-bye friend to a friend that you can hang out with, and even harder trenscend to a friend you can DNM till late. But don't worry, MarsTalk is here!!

MarsTalk is a social-networking app sepcially catered for University students. MarsTalk automatically matches you and another user that share similar background, interests, experiences and personality. Each day, you will get a new match and you will be able to talk to the user for 24 hours. During this 24 hours period, you may decide to add the user as a friend or let it go pass.
If you feel like one user per day is not enough for your likings, then you may choose to be assigned to a group each day. A group consists of 6 users, 3 males and 3 females, all of them will share similar background and interests. 

MarsTalk allows you to at least connect and talk to a new person everyday. Your daily match might have been in the same class as you or might have played LOL with you at one time or might even be your tutor. With MarsTalk you can enjoy the excitement of meeting new friends everyday and get exposed to a huge number of people who you might be able to closely relate to.
